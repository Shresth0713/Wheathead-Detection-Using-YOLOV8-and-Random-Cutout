We have used 7 types of wheat species from Global WheatHead Dataset and combined them together, applied random cutout method and then trained using YOLOV8. 
By masking the wheatheads we are giving our model a partial view of the wheatheads so that out models learns about the occlusion.
This is the image after using random cutout
